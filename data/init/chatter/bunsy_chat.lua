    "Oh dear me, I forgot my manners! My name is Bunsy and I'm a hare, nice to meet you darling!",
    "Enjoying your stay at Bunnyland, darling? I surely hope so!",
    "Do you like carrots?",
    "I'm thankful for our local farmer bunnymen! They are the ones tending our carrot corps!",
    "Pssh..listen! There is a myth, that says there is huge bunnyman somewhere that guards a treasure chest!",
    "Don't forget, bunnymen hate meat! So be careful what you are carrying when strolling in our land.",
    "Did you know, dear? Bunnymen out here come out in a variety of colors, cause white is overrated, ha!",
    "Have you seen the local bunneefalos? You should! They are cute and faster than their original ancestors",
    "You should consider wearing a bunny hat, comes very useful.",
    "Ah darling, I hope you haven't been cutting down puff trees now, have you? Those beautiful plants keep the land fluffy.",
    "I must admit though, puff tree's seeds taste delish, as crispy as a fresh carrot!",
    "Lemme tell you a tip dear, if you wanna befriend a carrody you better have some carrots to give it.",
    "Oh dear, you won't believe what I saw yesterday! A pigman wearing a bunnyhat! Those piggies are adaptive, they tryin' to fool us!",
    "Sweetcheecks, I'm glad you are having fun in Bunnyland, but you don't be scared to travel in other worlds too!",
