* Graypigs now have a small insanity aura, unless they are following you. In wereform their insanity aura is great as usual.
* Graypigs now attack players that have 25% or less of their sanity remaining. In combination with the above, this means that graypigs potentially pose a huge threat.
* Chillpigs now have a slight cooling effect of -10F on their surroundings.
