----------

* Graypigs now have a small insanity aura, unless they are following you. In wereform their insanity aura is great as usual.
* Graypigs now attack players that have 25% or less of their sanity remaining. In combination with the above, this means that graypigs potentially pose a huge threat.
* Chillpigs now have a slight cooling effect of -10F on their surroundings.
* Yellowpigs now always attack players and mobs, unless they are seen as "one of them", which means that either they are wet enough, or they have specific "slimey" items in their inventory. Yellowpigs do not distinguish between monsters and non-monsters. So wet spiders are not attacked by yellowpigs either.
* Added recipe for yellowgems being made of phlegm.
* Added a 5% chance that a yellowpig in wereform drops a yellowgem recipe.
* A wet yellowpig in wereform will drop two phlegm instead of two meat.
